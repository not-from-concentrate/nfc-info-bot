The difference between the types is whether the ridge for locking the plug in points toward the GPU's PCB or away from it.\n\nMost adapters still have pins sticking out the back, covered by a foam pad. However, the pins can still poke through the foam, causing a component-destroying high-current short. Remove the pad, sand/file down the pins, and then reinstall the pad. 180 degree adapters from NFC Systems already have this modification.",

First, custom power cabling will be likely since the main power input needs to run farther to reach the AC-DC unit, and the 24-pin and 8-pin power need to run further to reach the motherboard. Second, the original version (not marked with a version number) of the AC-DC unit is too thick to fit flush along the front of the chassis.
