The difference between the types is whether the ridge for locking the plug in points toward the GPU's PCB or away from it.\n\nMost adapters still have pins sticking out the back, covered by a foam pad. However, the pins can still poke through the foam, causing a component-destroying high-current short. Remove the pad, sand/file down the pins, and then reinstall the pad. 180 degree adapters from NFC Systems already have this modification.",

Details on this unit are still unknown.\n\nThe HDPlex 400W NanoATX combo power supply is currently the best and most compatible power supply for the S4M, mostly because Josh works with the HDPlex designer to address fitment issues and new designs. It separates the two functions of a power supply (AC->DC conversion and DC voltage step-down) into two separate units to allow for more compact placement. HDPlex also offers a cheaper and more compact 200W combo that may be appropriate for lower-power builds.\n\nFor info about HDPlex PSUs currently in production, use **!gan** command.",

This allows extra clearance since the DC-ATX unit is thinner, but it presents two extra challenges. First, custom power cabling will be likely since the main power input needs to run farther to reach the AC-DC unit, and the 24-pin and 8-pin power need to run further to reach the motherboard. Second, the original version (not marked with a version number) of the AC-DC unit is too thick to fit flush along the front of the chassis. It either needs to have a section milled out to fit, or you need to use a version 2.0 AC-DC unit (made thinner to fit).",

If you feel that you must mount it, then as per Josh, \"Use mounting tape. Grey/clear/or whatever from Scotch/3M if you NEED to, because it will come off without leaving sticky residue behind. And it's REALLY strong, way stronger than velcro. Velcro can hold really well, but it still vibrates in the hooks. Mounting tape doesn't.\" See: https://imgur.com/a/BqD27j2",
