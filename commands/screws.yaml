title: Info on chassis screws
description: "The screws used on the S4 chassis are M3 and use a 120° countersunk head (most screws at hardware stores are 90° and will not sit flush). A seller on eBay sells screws that have been confirmed to work with the S4 chassis, but requires the use of a size #1 Phillips head rather than the #2 used for original S4 screws."
