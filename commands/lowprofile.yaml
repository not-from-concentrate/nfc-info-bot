title: Low Profile PCIe
description: 180 adapters work in many cases, but if they are still just a bit too thick, ultra-low-profile cables are the way to go. Ultra-low-profile cables do away with the plastic connector, leaving the individual wires with plugs attached, and those plugs are then slotted directly onto the pins on the GPU. Be _very_ careful to triple-check pinout before applying power.

    value: There are vendors who make low-profile cables, such as [Kareon Kables](https://kareonkables.com/products/nfc-skyreach-hdplex-dc-atx-series-ultra-low-profile-pci-e-psu-cable). These can be a good choice, but be _very_ careful and verify the correct pin-out anyway. Several members have had equipment damaged by incorrectly made 3rd-party cables.
