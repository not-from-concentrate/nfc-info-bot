title: General PSU info
description: >-
  Skyreach cases have specific space constraints that severely limit
  power supply options.

  Most builders use power supplies from HDPlex which are designed with Skyreach cases in mind (or vice versa) - for more info on HDPlex PSUs in production, refer to !gan command. For legacy HDPlex supplies, refer to !hdplex command.

  More advanced builds (usually with STX motherboards) require even more specialized PSUs (see MEAN WELL PSUs below) and typically involve soldering and/or other hardware mods - not recommended for those faint of heart.
