  HDPlex has introduced a new line of GaN-based SFF PSUs intended to
  replace the existing 400W and 200W units. 250W and 500W units are readily
  available.

  Unlike previous HDPlex units where the AC-DC and DC-ATX conversion is done in separate units (a split PSU), the GaN units are all-in-one.

  For info about legacy HDPlex PSUs, use **!hdplex** command.

      •The 250W unit will fit in the front of the S4T chassis.

      •Two 250W units can be installed in the S4M and S4T expansion kit builds, with one unit to power the GPU and one to power the motherboard. In a dual PSU configuration, a jumper wire is used to allow the PSU powering the motherboard to control the second PSU. The dual configuration _does not_ combine the power to provide a single 500W source; it provides two discrete 250W sources.

      •The 500W unit will fit in front position in S4M but it's [very tight
      fit](https://discord.com/channels/516778810029506600/545061165420773396/1180761986687057930).

      • Fitting under GPU is theoretically possible, provided GPU height is under 110mm but no finished build has been shared yet.
