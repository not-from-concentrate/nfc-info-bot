description: The S4M is designed with a specific Schurter C6 inlet in mind. If you use an HDPlex 400 and it includes a C6, it is a different model and will be too long.

    value: This Schurter C6 ([Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/693-4300.0101)/[DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=4300.0101)) is very similar to the one the S4M was designed for, but still needs to be shaved down a bit on the sides to fit. It should also be mounted from the outside.
