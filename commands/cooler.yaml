  - name: AXP90-x36 (with NA-FD1 duct)
    value: "[This tiny cooler](http://www.thermalright.com/product/axp90-x36/) has surpassed Noctua L9x coolers in cooling performance while providing virtually identical compatibility. Noctua fan swap and fan duct highly recommended (note that fan duct needs to be affixed using tape or using similar method) - see Noctua product links."
    inline: false
  - name: Noctua NH-L9x with NA-FD1 duct
    value: >-
      One of the smallest and quietest CPU coolers on the market - great
      all-rounder with no compatibility issues. For use with 65W base TDP
      CPUs. Also available in black under 'chromax' name.

      NA-FD1 Fan duct improves temperatures and muffles the fan noise - highly recommended.

      • [Intel - NH-L9i](https://noctua.at/en/nh-l9i) - **Intel** variant -
      LGA115X and LGA1200 compatible.

      • [Intel - NH-L9i-17xx](https://noctua.at/en/nh-l9i-17xx) - Revised L9i with LGA1700 mount kit.

      • [AMD - NH-L9a](https://noctua.at/en/nh-l9a) - **AMD** variant - AM2(+), AM3(+), FM1 and FM2(+) compatible.

      • [AMD - NH-L9a-AM4](https://noctua.at/en/nh-l9a-am4) - **AMD** variant - Revised L9a with AM4 mount kit.

    inline: false
  - name: Metalfish Z39
    value: C-shaped alternative to NH-L9x with similar performance. Heatpipes can cause compatibility issues (i.e. interfere with M.2 stacks or VRAM heatsinks). For use with 65W base TDP CPUs. Compatible with LGA115X, LGA1200, LGA1700, AM3, AM4 and AM5.

  - name: Alpenföhn Black Ridge
    value: >-
      Larger C-shaped cooler with two possible fan configurations and common
      motherboard compatibility issues. For use with 95W base TDP CPUs.
      Compatible with LGA115X, LGA1200 and AM4 OOTB. Mount kit available for
      LGA1700.

      • Slim 92mm fan mode: RAM height limited to 33mm.

      • Slim 120mm fan mode: RAM height limited to 18mm (see **!vlp** for viable RAM kits).

      **Stand-off mod**: It is recommended to put spacers in between the fan and heatsink when installed as intake. Foam ducts are available for both configurations.

      **S4M note**: Most Black Ridge coolers will not fit S4M out of the box. Slight bending of heatpipes is required to get the height below 45mm. The bending can further affect RAM height limits.

  - name: (S4T only) ID-Cooling IS-47K
    value: >-
      Black Ridge alternative with slightly improved motherboard compatibility,
      no RAM limitations and similar cooling capacity. Compatible with
      LGA115x, LGA1200 and AM4 OOTB. 3rd party mount kit for LGA1700
      intermittently available on AliExpress.

    inline: false
  - name: NOT recommended
    value: >-
      • Any cooler below 37mm height: NH-L9x outperforms them in everything
      except cost.

      • Any cooler at or above 44mm height with fan on top: Fan running too close to side panel will cause turbulence. Examples: Cryorig C7, Thermalright AXP-90.

      • MasterAir G200P: Surpassed by both NH-L9x and Z39.
